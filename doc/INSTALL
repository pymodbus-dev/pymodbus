Requirements
-------------

* Python 2.3 or later.
* Python Twisted
* Pyserial

On Windows pywin32 is recommended (this is built in to ActivePython,
so no need to reinstall if you use it instead of standard Python):

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018

The Windows IOCP reactor requires pywin32 build 205 or later.


Installation
-------------

To install the package from pypi, use either easy_install or pip::

    pip install  -U pymodbus
    easy_install -U pymodbus

As with other Python packages, the standard way of installing from source
is (as root or administrator)::

    python setup.py install


Running Tests
--------------

The tests can be run with the built in unittest module, however, it is
much easier to run with the nose package.  With that installed, you can
use either of the following::

    python setup.py test
    nosetests


Building Documentation
----------------------

The documentation is written in restructured text using the sphinx module.
Building it is as simple as::

    python setup build_sphinx

The API documents can be generated using one of four programs:

* epydoc
* pydoc
* pydoctor
* doxygen

To bulid these, simply run the following command and the available
packages will sipmly be built::

    python setup.py build_apidocs


Quality Tests
----------------------

There are a number of quality tests that can be run against the code base
aside from unit tests::

    python setup.py scan_2to3  # run a python3 compatability test
    python setup.py pep8       # run a pop8 standards test
    python setup.py lint       # run a lint test
