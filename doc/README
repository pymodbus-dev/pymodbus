# About Pymodbus
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------# 
Pymodbus is a full Modbus protocol implementation using twisted for its
comunications core.

This package can supply modbus clients and servers:
	client:
	- Can perform single get/set on discretes and registers
	- Can perform multiple get/set on discretes and registers
	- Working on diagnostic/file/pipe/setting/info requets
	- Can fully scrape a host to be cloned

	server:
	- Can funtion as a fully implemented TCP modbus server
	- Working on creating server control context
	- Working on serial communication
	- Working on funtioning as a RTU/ASCII
	- Can mimic a server based on the supplied input data

# Use Cases
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------# 
Although most system administrators will find little need for a modbus
server on any modern hardware, they may find the need to query devices on
their network for status (PDU, PDR, UPS, etc).  Since the library is written
in python, it allows for easy scripting and/or integration into their existing
solutions.

Continuing, most monitoring software needs to be stress tested against
hundreds or even thousands of devices (why this was originally written), but
getting access to that many is unweildy at best.  The server will allow
one to test as many devices as the base operating system will allow ip
address leases (linux allows just about as many virtual interfaces as you want)
