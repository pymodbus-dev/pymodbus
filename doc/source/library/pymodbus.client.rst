pymodbus\.client
================

Pymodbus offers a :mod:`synchronous client <pymodbus.client>` and a :mod:`client based on asyncio <pymodbus.client.asynchronous>`.

The documentation is divided in 2 parts , to keep it simple.

First part is centered around the connection (establishing/terminating)

Second part is centered around the calls to get/set information in the connected device.
