Roadmap
=======

The roadmap is not a finite plan, but merely an expression of intentions !

Pymodbus development is mainly driven by contributors, who have an itch, and provide a solution for the community.
The maintainers are very open to these pull request, and ONLY work to secure that:

- it does not break existing usage/functionality (PR put on hold for next API change release)
- it is a generic feature (e.g. not just for serial 9.600 bps)
- it have proper test cases, to ensure against side effects.

It is important to note the maintainer do NOT reject ANY pull request that emcompases the above criteria.
It is the community that decides how pymodbus evolves NOT the maintainers !

The following bullet points are what the maintainers focus on:

- 3.7.4, bug fix release, hopefully with:
    - Available on dev:
        - optimized framer, limited support for multidrop on the server side
        - more typing in the core
        - 100% test coverage fixed for all new parts (currently transport and framer)
        - Updated PDU, moving client/server decoder into pdu
    - better client no_response handling
    - Simplify PDU classes
    - better retry handling (only disconnect when really needed)
- 3.7.5, bug fix release, hopefully with:
    - 100% test coverage for pdu
    - better broadcast handling
- 3.7.6, bug fix release, with:
    - Foundation for new transaction
- 3.8.0, with:
    - new transaction handling
- 4.0.0, with:
    - client async, but with sync/async API
    - Only one datastore, but with different API`s
    - Simulator standard in server
    - GUI client, to analyze devices
    - GUI server, to simulate devices

All contributions are WELCOME, and we (the maintainers) are always open to talk about ideas,
best way is via `discussions <https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/discussions>`_ on github.

We have lately decided, that we do strictly follow the `modbus org <https://modbus.org>`_ standard,
but we also accept vendor specific (like Huawei) pull requests, as long as they extend the standard or are actitvated with
a specific argument like --huawei.
