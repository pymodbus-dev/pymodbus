Asynchronous Processor Example
==================================================

Below is a simplified asynchronous client skeleton that was
submitted by a user of the library.  It can be used as a guide
for implementing more complex pollers or state machines.

Feel free to test it against whatever device you currently have
available.  If you do not have a device to test with, feel free
to run a pymodbus server instance or start the reference tester in
the tools directory.
