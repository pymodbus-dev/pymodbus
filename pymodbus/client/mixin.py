    This is an interface class to facilitate the sending requests/receiving responses like read_coils.
    execute() allows to make a call with non-standard or user defined function codes (remember to add a PDU
    in the transport class to interpret the request/response).

    Simple modbus message call::

        response = client.read_coils(1, 10)
        # or
        response = await client.read_coils(1, 10)

    Advanced modbus message call::

        request = ReadCoilsRequest(1,10)
        response = client.execute(request)
        # or
        request = ReadCoilsRequest(1,10)
        response = await client.execute(request)

    .. tip::
        All methods can be used directly (synchronous) or
        with await <method> (asynchronous) depending on the client used.

        remote device since its last restart, clear counters operation, or
        power-up. This count is identical to that returned by the Diagnostic
        function Return Bus Message Count.

        The event bytes field contains 0-64 bytes, with each byte corresponding
        to the status of one MODBUS send or receive operation for the remote
        device. The remote device enters the events into the field in
        chronological order. Byte 0 is the most recent event. Each new byte
        flushes the oldest byte from the field.
