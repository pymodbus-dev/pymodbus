class Defaults(Singleton):  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
    """A collection of modbus default values.

    .. attribute:: Port

       The default modbus tcp server port (502)

    .. attribute:: TLSPort

       The default modbus tcp over tls server port (802)


    .. attribute:: Backoff

       The default exponential backoff delay (0.3 seconds)

    .. attribute:: Retries

       The default number of times a client should retry the given
       request before failing (3)

    .. attribute:: RetryOnEmpty

       A flag indicating if a transaction should be retried in the
       case that an empty response is received. This is useful for
       slow clients that may need more time to process a request.

    .. attribute:: RetryOnInvalid

       A flag indicating if a transaction should be retried in the
       case that an invalid response is received.

    .. attribute:: Timeout

       The default amount of time a client should wait for a request
       to be processed (3 seconds)

    .. attribute:: Reconnects

       The default number of times a client should attempt to reconnect
       before deciding the server is down (0)

    .. attribute:: TransactionId

       The starting transaction identifier number (0)

    .. attribute:: ProtocolId

       The modbus protocol id.  Currently this is set to 0 in all
       but proprietary implementations.

    .. attribute:: UnitId

       The modbus slave addrss.  Currently this is set to 0x00 which
       means this request should be broadcast to all the slave devices
       (really means that all the devices should respond).

    .. attribute:: Baudrate

       The speed at which the data is transmitted over the serial line.
       This defaults to 19200.

    .. attribute:: Parity

       The type of checksum to use to verify data integrity. This can be
       on of the following::

         - (E)ven - 1 0 1 0 | P(0)
         - (O)dd  - 1 0 1 0 | P(1)
         - (N)one - 1 0 1 0 | no parity

       This defaults to (N)one.

    .. attribute:: Bytesize

       The number of bits in a byte of serial data.  This can be one of
       5, 6, 7, or 8. This defaults to 8.

    .. attribute:: Stopbits

       The number of bits sent after each character in a message to
       indicate the end of the byte.  This defaults to 1.

    .. attribute:: ZeroMode

       Indicates if the slave datastore should use indexing at 0 or 1.
       More about this can be read in section 4.4 of the modbus specification.

    .. attribute:: IgnoreMissingSlaves

       In case a request is made to a missing slave, this defines if an error
       should be returned or simply ignored. This is useful for the case of a
       serial server emulater where a request to a non-existent slave on a bus
       will never respond. The client in this case will simply timeout.

    .. attribute:: broadcast_enable

      When False unit_id 0 will be treated as any other unit_id. When True and
      the unit_id is 0 the server will execute all requests on all server
      contexts and not respond and the client will skip trying to receive a
      response. Default value False does not conform to Modbus spec but maintains
      legacy behavior for existing pymodbus users.
