            value=-123456

        .. code-block:: python

        SimData(
            address=100,
            count=17,
            value=-True
            datatype=SimDataType.BITS
        )

    The above code defines 17 BITS (coils), each with the value True. In non-shared mode addresses are 100-115.

    in shared mode BITS are stored in registers (16bit is one register), the address refer to the register,
    addresses are 100-101 (with register 101 being padded with 15 bits)

    .. tip:: use SimDatatype.DEFAULT to define register limits:

    .. code-block:: python

        SimData(
            address=0,    # First legal registers
            count=1000,   # last legal register is r+count-1
            value=0x1234  # Default register value
            datatype=SimDataType.DEFAULT
        )

    The above code sets the range of legal registers to 0..999 all with the value 0x1234.
    Accessing non-defined registers will cause an exception response.

    Remark that DEFAULT can be overwritten with other definitions:

    .. code-block:: python

        SimData(
            address=0,    # First legal registers
            count=1000,   # last legal register is r+count-1
            value=0x1234  # Default register value

            datatype=SimDataType.INT32
        )

    Is a legal and normal combination.

    .. attention:: Using SimDataType.DEFAULT is a LOT more efficient to define all registers, than \
    the other datatypes. This is because default registers are not created unless written to, whereas \
